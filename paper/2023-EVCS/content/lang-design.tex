We begin our discussion by detailing the key design rationale on
realising the static semantics of \Velo{} within \Idris{}.

We have opted to give \Velo{} an external concrete syntax (a \ac{dsl})
in which users can write their programs.
%
With dependently typed languages, however, we can also capture
the abstract syntax and its static semantics as an intrinsically
scoped and typed \ac{edsl}
directly within the host language~\cite{Augustsson1999edt}.

\textbf{Types} are usually introduced using their context free grammar.
%
We present it here on the left-hand side, it gives user the choice between
two base types (\TyNat, and \TyBool) and a type former for function types
(\TyFunc{\cdot}{\cdot}).
%
On the right hand side, we give its representation as an inductive
type in Idris 2.

\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\syntaxtypes
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{Verbatim}

data Ty = TyNat
        | TyBool
        | TyArr Ty Ty
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}

\textbf{Contexts} can be similarly given by a context free grammar:
a context is either empty ($\epsilon$), or an existing context ($\Gamma$)
extended on the right with a new type ($t$) using a comma.
%
In Idris 2, we will adopt a nameless representation and so we represent
these contexts by using a \IdrisData{SnocList} of types
(i.e. lists that grow on the right).

\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\syntaxcontexts
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{Verbatim}

data SnocList a
        = Lin
        | (:<) (SnocList a) a
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}

\todo{play with spaces, reread descriptions}

\textbf{Typing Judgements} are given by relations, and encoded in
Idris 2 using inductive families, a generalisation of inductive
types~\cite{DBLP:journals/fac/Dybjer94}.
%
Each rule will become a constructor for the family, and so every
proof \inferenceRule{} will correspond to a term $t$ of type
(\texttt{Term} $\Gamma$ $a$).

\begin{minipage}{0.10\textwidth}
\varRule
\inferenceRule
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.80\textwidth}
\begin{Verbatim}
data Elem : (ctxt : SnocList a) -> (type : a) -> Type where
data Term : (ctxt : SnocList Ty) -> (type : Ty) -> Type where
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}

We leave the definition of \IdrisData{Elem} to the next section,
focusing instead on \IdrisData{Term}.

The most basic of typing rules are axioms. They have no premise
and are mapped to constructors with no subterm. We use Idris 2
comments \texttt{----} to format our constructor's type in such
a way that they resemble the corresponding inference rule.
%
Here we show the rule stating that $0$ is a natural number.

\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\inferenceZero
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{Verbatim}
  Zero : ------------------
          Term ctxt TyNat
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}

Then come typing rules with a single premise which is not a subderivation.
They are mapped to constructor with a single argument. Here we show the
typing rule variables.

\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\inferenceVar
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{Verbatim}
  Var :  Elem ctxt a ->
        --------------
         Term ctxt a
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}

Next, we have typing rules with a single premise which is a subderivation.
They are mapped to constructor with a single subterm of the inductive family
representing the subderivation.
%
Here we show the typing rule for successor.

\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\inferenceInc
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{Verbatim}
  Inc :  Term ctxt TyNat ->
        ------------------
         Term ctxt TyNat
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}

Similarly, rules with two premises are translated to constructors
with two subterms, one for each subderivation.
%
Here we present the typing rule for application nodes: provided that
the function has a function type, and the argument has a type matching
the function's domain, the application has a type corresponding to the
function's codomain.
Note that the context $\Gamma$ is the same across the whole rule and,
correspondingly, the same \texttt{ctxt} is being referenced everywhere.

\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
\inferenceApp
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
\begin{Verbatim}
  App :  Term ctxt (TyArr a b) ->
         Term ctxt a ->
        ------------------------
         Term ctxt b
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}

Finally, we have a rule where the premise's context has been extended:
a function of type (\TyFunc{a}{b}) can be introduced by building a term
of type $b$ in a context extended with a new variable of type $a$.

\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
\inferenceFunc
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
\begin{Verbatim}
  Func :  Term (ctxt :< a) b ->
         ------------------------
          Term ctxt (TyArr a b)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}




%%           Inc  :  Term ctxt TyNat ->
%%          -------------------
%%           Term ctxt TyNat
%%   -- (...)
%% \end{Verbatim}


\noindent
Using such intrinsically typed \acp{edsl} we can statically verify for free
that our languages are well-structured and that any transformation (model-to-model)
or interpretation (model-to-host) respects the language's static semantics.
%
In fact we will describe in \Cref{sec:semantics} how we can use our \acp{edsl}
to both verify our static semantics whilst describing our dynamic semantics.

For languages equipped with more advanced type systems, that cannot be as easily
enforced statically, we can retain some of these guarantees by using a well
scoped core language rather than a well typed one.
%
This is the approach used in \Idris{} and it has already helped eliminate an
entire class of bugs arising when attempting to solve a metavariable with a
term that was defined in a different context~\cite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/Brady21}.
