We have shown that dependently typed languages satisfy the core requirements from the \emph{Language Workbench Challenge}~\cite{DBLP:conf/sle/ErdwegSVBBCGHKLKMPPSSSVVVWW13}.
%
\Velo{}'s \emph{notation} as a \ac{dsl} is, by design, textual, and the internal core bounded by \Idris{}'s own notation requirements.
%
More importantly the \emph{semantics} (statics and dynamics) of \Velo{}
are verified as part of the implementation thanks to the dependently typed setting.
%
The weakest supported core criteria, unfortunately, is that for \emph{editor} support.
%
Languages created through \Idris{} do not get an editor, they are free form languages which require their parsers and elaborators be hand written.
This can change with future investigation.
\Idris{} has support for elaborator reflection~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/ChristiansenB16} which provides a vehicle through which deriving parsers and elaborators can happen.


There are, however, more criteria from the language workbench feature model to consider:
%
semantic \& syntactic services for editors;
%
testing \& debugging;
%
and
%
composability.
%

With the rise of the \ac{lsp} it would be a good idea to look at how we can derive \ac{lsp} compatible language servers generically, thus addressing the missing provision of the optional semantic and syntactic services.
\Idris{} itself provides an \emph{IDE-Protocol}
% ~\cite{MANUAL:dtp/Christiansen2014} -- removed due to space limitations on bibliography
, and there is support for the \ac{lsp} in \Idris{}.
%\footnote{\url{https://github.com/idris-community/idris2-lsp}}

Our languages also do not come with the ability to test and debug their
implementation.
%
Some of the features we have presented are fully formalised (e.g.\ execution),
others are only known to be scope-and-type preserving (e.g.\ \ac{cse}).
%
Therefore the dependently typed setting does not mean we do not need testing
anymore.
%
Prior work on generators for inductive families~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/LampropoulosPP18}
should allow us to bring property-based testing~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/ClaessenH00} to our core passes.


Finally there is language composability.
%
We have already seen (\Cref{sec:design:constants}) how \Velo{} can embed one language (that of primitives \& application) into the \ac{stlc}. % albeit for one language.
%
It would be an advantageous idea to support the reuse of existing languages, and their type-systems when designing new ones.
%
This is a hard problem:
%
One has to not only combine their semantics but also the remainder of the workbench tooling.
%
The \emph{language fragments} approach~\cite{10.1145/3563355} does provide a solution to language composability for intrinsically typed definitional interpreters, but this does not extend to workbench tooling.
How the language fragments approach applied to our approach to realising semantics (based on inductive families) and also to creating composable workbench tooling is an open area of investigation.
%The \emph{Effects} library~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/Brady13} provides clues as to how we can compose \acp{dsl} horizontally but not vertically .


We strongly believe that with future engineering we can satisfy these missing criteria,
and make dependently typed languages a mighty fine language workbench.
