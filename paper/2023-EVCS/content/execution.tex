The \Velo{} \acs*{repl} will let users reduce terms down to head-normal forms.
%
We can realise \Velo{}'s dynamic semantics either through definitional
interpreters~\cite{10.1145/3093333.3009866,Augustsson1999edt},
or by providing a more traditional syntactic proof of
type-soundness~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/WrightF94}
but mechanised~\cite[Part 2: Properties]{plfa22.08} using inductive families.

We chose the latter approach: by using inductive families, we can make explicit
our language's operational semantics.
%
This enables us to study its meta-theoretical properties and in particular prove
a progress result: every term is either a value or can take a reduction step.
%
By repeatedly applying the progress result, until we either reach a value or the end
user runs out of patience and kills the process, this proof freely gives us an
evaluator that is guaranteed to be correct with respect to \Velo{}'s operational
semantics.

Following existing approaches~\cite[Part 2: Properties]{plfa22.08}, we have defined
inductive families describing how terms reduce.

\ExecuteMetaData[Code/MiniExecute.idr.tex]{ReduxDef}

As can be seen above, our setting enforces call-by-value:
as described by the rule \IdrisData{ReduceFuncApp}
(\exprApp{\exprLam{b}}{t}) only reduces to
($b \, \lbrace x \leftarrow t \rbrace$)
if $t$ is already known to be a value.
%
Furthermore, our algebraic design (\Cref{sec:design:constants}) allows
us to easily enforce a left-to-right evaluation order by having a generic
family describing how primitive operations' arguments reduce.
%
As can be seen below: when considering a type-aligned list of arguments,
either the \IdrisBound{hd} takes a step and the \IdrisBound{rest} is unchanged,
or the \IdrisBound{hd} is already known to be a value and a further argument
is therefore allowed to take a step.

\ExecuteMetaData[Code/MiniExecute.idr.tex]{ReducesDef}

We differ, however, from standard approaches by making our proofs of progress generic
such that the boilerplate for computing the reflexive transitive closure
when reducing terms is tidied away in a shareable module.
%
Our top-level progress definition is thus parameterised by reduction and value definitions:

\ExecuteMetaData[Code/MiniExecute.idr.tex]{ProgressDef}

\noindent
and the result of execution, which is similarly parameterised, is as follows
(where \IdrisType{RTList} is the type taking a relation and returning its
reflexive-transitive closure):

\ExecuteMetaData[Code/MiniExecute.idr.tex]{ResultDef}

The benefit of our approach is that language designers need only provide details of
what reductions are,
and how to compute a single reduction, the rest comes for free.
%
Moreover, with the result of evaluation we also get the list of reduction steps made that can, optionally, be printed to show a trace of execution.
